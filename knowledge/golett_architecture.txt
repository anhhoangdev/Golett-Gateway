# Golett Gateway Architecture

Golett Gateway is a sophisticated conversational AI framework that combines the power of CrewAI with advanced memory management capabilities.

## Core Components

### Memory System
The memory system is the foundation of Golett Gateway, providing persistent storage and intelligent retrieval:

- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Handles structured data including conversation history, session metadata, user preferences, and decision tracking
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: Manages vector embeddings for semantic search and similarity-based retrieval
- **Dual Storage Architecture**: Combines the reliability of relational databases with the power of vector search

### Knowledge Management
Golett's knowledge system provides multiple layers of information access:

- **File-based Sources**: Text files, PDFs, and structured documents
- **Memory-based Sources**: Conversation context and learned information
- **API Sources**: External data sources and real-time information
- **Contextual Integration**: Automatic fusion of knowledge with conversation context

### Agent Coordination
CrewAI integration enables sophisticated multi-agent collaboration:

- **Specialized Agents**: Query analyzers, response strategists, content generators
- **Workflow Management**: Sequential and hierarchical task execution
- **Context Sharing**: Agents share information through common memory
- **Decision Tracking**: All agent decisions are logged and retrievable

## Technical Benefits

### Persistence
Unlike traditional chatbots that lose context between sessions, Golett maintains:
- Long-term conversation memory
- User preference learning
- Knowledge accumulation over time
- Decision history and reasoning chains

### Scalability
The modular architecture supports:
- Horizontal scaling of individual components
- Independent service deployment
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Efficient resource utilization

### Intelligence
Advanced AI capabilities include:
- Multi-agent problem solving
- Contextual knowledge retrieval
- Adaptive response generation
- Business intelligence integration
