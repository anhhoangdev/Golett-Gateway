Golett Gateway Technical Implementation Details

Memory Management System:

The memory system in Golett Gateway uses a dual-storage approach to handle both structured and unstructured data efficiently:

1. PostgreSQL Storage:
   - Stores structured conversation data, session metadata, and user information
   - Handles relational data with ACID compliance
   - Supports complex queries for session management and analytics
   - Includes tables for sessions, messages, context, and decision tracking

2. Qdrant Vector Storage:
   - Stores vector embeddings of conversation content for semantic search
   - Enables similarity-based retrieval of relevant historical information
   - Supports high-dimensional vector operations with efficient indexing
   - Provides real-time vector search capabilities

Session Management:

Sessions in Golett Gateway are persistent entities that maintain conversation state across multiple interactions:

- Each session has a unique identifier and associated metadata
- Sessions can be active or inactive, with automatic timeout handling
- Context is preserved across session boundaries
- Session history is searchable and retrievable

CrewAI Integration:

Golett Gateway leverages CrewAI for multi-agent collaboration:

1. Agent Roles:
   - Query Analyzer: Interprets user intent and extracts key information
   - Response Strategist: Determines the best approach for responding
   - Content Generator: Creates the actual response content
   - Context Manager: Manages conversation context and memory

2. Agent Coordination:
   - Agents work together in a coordinated workflow
   - Information is shared between agents through a common context
   - Decision-making is distributed across specialized agents
   - Results are aggregated into coherent responses

Knowledge Sources:

The knowledge system supports multiple types of sources:

- Text files (.txt, .md)
- PDF documents
- Structured data files (JSON, YAML)
- Web-based sources (URLs)
- Database queries

Knowledge Integration Process:

1. Source Discovery: Automatically detects available knowledge sources
2. Content Extraction: Extracts text content from various file formats
3. Embedding Generation: Creates vector embeddings for semantic search
4. Index Creation: Builds searchable indexes for efficient retrieval
5. Context Fusion: Combines knowledge with conversation context

API Architecture:

The FastAPI-based REST API provides:

- Session management endpoints
- Chat interaction endpoints
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Administrative endpoints
- WebSocket support for real-time communication

Deployment Architecture:

Golett Gateway is designed for containerized deployment:

- Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- Separate containers for each service component
- Health checks and automatic restart capabilities
- Volume mounting for persistent data storage
- Environment-based configuration management

Performance Considerations:

- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Monitoring and logging for performance tracking

Security Features:

- Environment-based secret management
- Database connection encryption
- API authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for security events

Scalability Design:

- Horizontal scaling support for stateless components
- Database sharding capabilities for large datasets
- Load balancing for high-availability deployments
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Event-driven communication between components
