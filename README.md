Welcome, Data Trainer! **Golett Gateway** is your access point to a powerful system of **Agentic Business Intelligence (BI) Agents**. Built on the `crewAI` framework, this system allows you to pose business questions in plain language and receive insightful answers, all orchestrated by a dedicated crew of AI agents.

Think of each 'Golett' in your crew as a specialized data assistant: one might be a **Query Golett** digging into databases, another a **Processor Golett** sifting through the findings, and a **Reporter Golett** presenting clear insights. The Gateway is where you issue your 'research quests' and receive their distilled wisdom.
